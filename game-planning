<!-- The idea first is to get a shitty game that works, and which we can improve later on -->

*** Milestone 1: user can move the player left right ***

[x] initial setup (html, css, js)
[x] create git repo

- Player class
    - Position
    - size
    - appearance?
    - moveLeft()
    - moveRight()
    - startPosition / stop?

[x] detect keyboard events (Decide if player moves left/right)


*** Milestone 2: obstacles appearing in the UI + obstacles move + detect if there is a collision ***
        (note: for this milestone, it's ok if obstacles appear always at the same position) 

<!-- At this stage we'll have our shitty game -->

[x] Obstacle class
  - width
  - height
  - positionX
  - positionY
  - domElement
  - createDomElement();
  - moveDown();

Milestone 3: make the game interesting and add functionalities
